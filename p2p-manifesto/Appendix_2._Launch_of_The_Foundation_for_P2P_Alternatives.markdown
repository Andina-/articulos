Appendix 2. Launch of The Foundation for P2P Alternatives
=========================================================

From P2P Foundation

**Appendix 2. Launch of [The Foundation for P2P Alternatives][]**

\
 My purpose in this book is also political. I believe that a P2P-based
civilization, or at least one that has much stronger elements of it
compared with today, would be a better civilization, more apt to tackle
the global challenges that we are facing. This is why I propose that
this essay is not just part of a process of understanding, but that it
can be a guide to an active participation in the transformation of our
world, into something better, more participative, more free, more
creative.

I therefore announce the creation of a Foundation for P2P Alternatives.
It would be centered around the following conclusions, the support for
which you can find in the essay:

- that technology reflects a change of consciousness towards
participation, and in turn strengthens it

- that the networked format, expressed in the specific manner of peer to
peer relations, is a new form of political organizing and subjectivity,
and an alternative for the political/economic order, which though it
does not offer solutions per se, points the way to a variety of
dialogical and self-organizing formats to device different processes for
arriving at such solutions; it ushers in a era of ‘nonrepresentational
democracy’, where an increasing number of people are able to manage
their social and productive life through the use of a variety of
networks and peer circles

- that it creates a new public domain, an information commons, which
should be protected and extended, especially in the domain of common
knowledge creation; and that this domain, where the cost of reproducing
knowledge is near zero, requires fundamental changes in the intellectual
property regime, as reflected by new forms such as the free software
movement

- that the principles developed by the free software movement, in
particular the General Public License, provides for models that could be
used in other areas of social and productive life - that it reconnects
with the older traditions and attempts for a more cooperative social
order, but this time obviates the need for authoritarianism and
centralization; it has the potential of showing that the new egalitarian
digital culture, is connected to the older traditions of cooperation of
the workers and peasants, and to the search for an engaged and
meaningful life as expressed in one’s work, which becomes an expression
of individual and collective creativity, rather than as a salaried means
of survival

- that it offers youth a vision of renewal and hope, to create a world
that is more in tune with their values; that it creates a new language
and discourse in tune with the new historical phase of ‘cognitive
capitalism’; P2P is a language which every ‘digital youngster’ can
understand

- it combines subjectivity (new values), intersubjectivity (new
relations), objectivity (an enabling technology) and interobjectivity
(new forms of organization) that mutually strengthen each other in a
positive feedback loop, and it is clearly on the offensive and growing,
but lacking ‘political self-consciousness’.

The Foundation for P2P Alternatives would address the following issues:

- P2P currently exists in discrete separate movements and projects but
these different movements are often unaware of the common P2P ethos that
binds them

- thus, there is a need for a common initiative, which 1) brings
information together; 2) connects people and mutually informs them 3)
strives for integrative insights coming from the many subfields; 4) can
organize events for reflection and action;5) can educate people about
critical and creative tools for world-making

- the Foundation would be a matrix or womb which would inspire the
creation and linking of other nodes active in the P2P field, organized
around topics and common interests, locality, and any form of identity
and organization which makes sense for the people involved

- the zero node website would have a website with directories, an
electronic newsletter and blog, and a magazine.
