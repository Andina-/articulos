4.1.D. Peer governance in peer production?
==========================================

**4.1.D. Peer governance in peer production?**

How does peer governance work in actual peer production processes, in
free software/open source projects for example?

Aaron Krowne has done useful work to define the authority models at work
in such projects. The models define access and the workflow, and whether
there is any quality control. The free-form model, which Wikipedia
employs, allows anyone to edit any entry at any time. But in the
owner-centric model, entries can only be modified with the permission of
a specific ‘owner’ who has to defend the integrity of his module. He
concludes that “These two models have different assumptions and effects.
The free-form model connotes more of a sense that all users are on the
“same level," and that expertise will be universally recognized and
deferred to. As a result, the creator of an entry is spared the trouble
of reviewing every change before it is integrated, as well as the need
to perform the integration. By contrast, the owner-centric authority
model assumes the owner is the de facto expert in the topic at hand,
above all others, and all others must defer to them. Because of this
arrangement, the owner must review all modification proposals, and take
the time to integrate the good ones. However, no non-expert will ever be
allowed to “damage" an entry, and therefore resorting to administrative
powers is vanishingly rare." The owner-centric model is better for
quality, but takes more time, while the free-form model increases scope
of coverage and is very fast. The choice between the two models can of
course be a contentious issue. In the case of the Wikipedia, the
adherents of the owner-centric model, active in the pre-Wikipedia
"Nupedia" model, lost out, and presumable, the success of Wikipedia has
proven them wrong, since the latter totally open process has been proven
a success . Similar conflicts are reported in many other projects .
Collaborative projects are no utopian scheme were everything is better,
but subject to intense human conflict as well. A general problem still
associated with FLOSS software is their lack of user-friendliness , they
are often made from the biases of a development community, and may have
less incentive than corporate entities, to make them customer-friendly,
which is why a niche has been created for service companies such as Red
Hat.

Another important aspect of FLOSS projects is how they handle
'equipotentiality'. While formal degrees have been abandoned, and open
participation is in principle encouraged, most projects will over time
produce a number of rules in their selection. The important aspect is
that these rules are generated within the community itself, though
mostly in the early phases. After a while, they tend to consolidate and
they are a given for the new participants who come later . At this
point, a process of socialization is crucial to eventual acceptance .
The process is akin to the tradition of artisanship, which has been used
in the three-degree system of original freemasonry as well: apprentice,
companion (fellow craft), master. But it is implied rather than
formalized.

Crucial to the success of many collaborative projects is their
implementation of the reputation schemes. They differ from previous
reputation-based systems, such as academic peer review, because the open
process of participation (equipotentiality) precludes a systematic
strengthening of reputation so that it could become a factor of
conservatism (as it is in science and its dependence on dominant
paradigms) and power. In the better P2P systems, reputation is
time-sensitive on the degree of recent participation and the possibility
of forking and of downgrading reputation grades, introduce an aspect of
community control, flexibility and dynamism. See in particular the
endnote on this topic, outlining the example of the NoLogo site .
Reputation-based schemes are crucial because cooperation is based on
trust, and they offer a collaborative scheme to indicate those who are
the best contributors to the common value, while motivating everybody to
use the more cooperative, and less the more baser sides of human
nature."
