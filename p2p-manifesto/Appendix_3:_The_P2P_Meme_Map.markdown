Appendix 3: The P2P Meme Map
============================

From P2P Foundation

Jump to: [navigation][], [search][]

**Appendix 3: The P2P Meme Map**

(**read the table from the bottom u**p)

Compiled by Michel Bauwens, June 30, 2005

The following is an attempt to summarize the findings of the P2P
research in a compressed manner.

Level one represents the cultural shift in ways of being, feeling and
knowing, as well as the new core value constellations that underpin the
shift to a peer to peer civilization.

Level two represents the technological distributed computing
infrastructure, the P2P media infrastructure which enables many-to-many
communication, and the collaborative infrastructure which allows
autonomous groups to cooperate on a global scale, outside the bounds of
markets and hierarchies.

Level three represents the legal infrastructure. The General Public
License (and Open Source initiatives), which creates and expands the P2P
technological infrastructure as a public domain Commons; Creative
Commons licenses achieve the same effect for content creation.
Technological protocols such as TCP/IP insure the participative nature
of new technologies, while P2P collectives set their own
internally-generated frameworks of cooperation, within the broader
framework of Internet-based civility (netiquette). Taking together they
create a common property regime of public goods outside the market and
the state.

Level 4 represents new social practices that are thoroughly
characterized by P2P principles (as distinguished from non-P2P formats
enabled by P2P infrastructures). The first strand is represented by
'non-representational politics', politics which refuses representation,
as exemplified by the alterglobalisation movement and Social Forums, the
coordination format adopted by social movements. Peer production creates
collective use value in the form of a Commons, and is exemplified by
free software, knowledge collectives such as Wikipedia, collaborative
publishing such as Indymedia. Participative spirituality represents a
new way of relating to religions, the cosmos, and nature and its beings,
refusing authoritarian truths and methods, sometimes practiced in the
form of peer circles.

Level 5 are practices that are not full P2P themselves, but are enabled
and strengthened by P2P infrastructures: examples are P2P marketplaces
which do not create a commons and are run by for-profit enterprises, or
who derive substantial value from user-created content ('netarchical'
enterprises who enable and exploit participative networks); gift
economies or sharing economies (the latter defined by Yochai Benkler),
such as local exchange trading systems and local currencies;

\
 **TO READ FROM THE BOTTOM UP!!!**

\

​1. Empire/cognitive capitalism rests on distributed networking but
instrumentalises it for domination

​2. P2P-based marketplaces and Long Tail economics: eBay, Zopa,
self-publishing; supply and demand meat each other through the internet;
creating millions of sustainable micro-markets

​3. Netarchical value creation / for-profit enablement and exploitation
of participative networks: positive externalities of P2P create value
for new type of businesses: Amazon customer evaluations, Google page
ranking based on user linking; user-centric innovation; users create
substantial content for the portals

​4. Bottom of the pyramid development schemes (Prahalad); microcredit
(collective credit applications); citizen to citizen (edge to edge)
development schemes (Jock Gill)

​5. Gift and sharing economy practices are enabled by P2P
infrastructures: open money and local currency schemes, local exchange
trading systems (LETS); carpooling becomes economical with distributed
infrastructures; nonprofit organizations and social entrepreneurships
are enabled. Lower transactional costs strengthen enable fairer trade
and economics

\
 Level 5: P2P-ENABLED PRACTICES

\
 1.A. Non-representational politics: networked alterglobalism,
coordination formats for social struggles, conceptual innovation of
multitudes (Negri), creation as resistance (Benasayag), revolution
without power (Holloway)

=\> CREATION OF ABSOLUTE DEMOCRACY MODELS

1.B. Autonomous social and cultural practices: internet-based affinity
groups, self-help and mutual support groups, non-expert dominated
knowledge creation, validation, and exchange, filesharing; open science
projects and open access to scientific publications

=\> CREATION OF THE INFORMATION COMMONS

​2. Peer production (also called, Commons-Based Peer Production CBPP):
Free software and open source software (also called Free/Libre Open
Source Software FLOSS): GNU/Linux; Knowledge collectives: Wikipedia,
Collaborative Media: Indymedia

=\> THIRD MODE OF PRODUCTION CREATES FOR-BENEFIT SECTOR

​3. Participatory spirituality: non-representational dialogue of
religion, contributory theology, cooperative inquiry practices (John
Heron), plural mysticism (Jorge Ferrer), peer circles

=\> PLURALISTIC CONTRIBUTORY SPIRITUALITY

\
 NON-REPRESENTATIONAL POLITICS & AUTONOMOUS SOCIAL ORGANISATION // PEER
PRODUCTION // PARTICIPATORY SPIRITUALITY

\

Level 4: DIRECT P2P PRACTICES

\
 1. New Common Property Regime: General Public License, Open Source
Initiative, Creative Commons, Art libre License allow for creation that
cannot be privately appropriated

​2. Participative Technological Protocols: TCP/IP protocol for P2P
communication, Writeable Web protocols allow self-publishing by
everyone, Viral Communicator Meshwork protocols enable network building
without infrastructures and backbones: Open Spectrum proposal would
create Wireless Commons

​3. Participative Social Protocols: netiquette, project constitutions,
social accounting and reputation-based schemes create transparency,
participation capture turns self-interest into common resources

\
 NEW COMMON PROPERTY REGIME // PARTICIPATIVE TECHNOLOGICAL PROTOCOLS //
PARTICIPATIVE SOCIAL PROTOCOLS

\
 Level 3: P2P LEGAL INFRASTRUCTURE

\
 1.A. Distributed computing infrastructure (hardware): Internet, Grid
Computing, Filesharing, Wireless Meshwork, Viral Communicators

1.B. Free Software / Open source software infrastructure: GNU/Linux, OS
Desktop applications, OS content management software, OS communication
tools

​2. Distributed media infrastructure: Blogging (Writeable Web),
Podcasting (audio), Webcasting (broadband audiovisual)

​3. Distributed collaboration infrastructure: Wiki's, social software,
groupware

DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING // DISTRIBUTED MEDIA // DISTRIBUTED COLLOBARATION

\
 Level two: P2P TECHNOLOGICAL INFRASTRUCTURE

\
 1. New ways of feeling and being: participative cosmologies, the
relational self, cooperative individualism

​2. New ways of knowing: connectivist learning, communal (not
institutional) validation of knowledge, transparency (not objectivity)

​3. Primacy of Equality/freedom, the hacker ethic of self-unfolding
'passion-based' cooperation, abundance over scarcity, participation over
exclusion, meritocratic servant leadership by example, coordination
instead of command and control

​4. Desire for P2P Civilization to be defined by: 1) Absolute Democracy:
participation of all extended to all areas of social life, not just
politics; a Pluralist Economy with a strong Commons sector along with a
reformed market and state; a Participative Universe based on partnership
with nature and its beings

\
 P2P ONTOLOGY // P2P EPISTEMOLOGY // P2P AXIOLOGY

(New ways of feeling and being // New ways of knowing // New core value
constellation and aspirations)

\
 Level one: P2P CULTURAL FOUNDATIONS AND VALUE FIELD
