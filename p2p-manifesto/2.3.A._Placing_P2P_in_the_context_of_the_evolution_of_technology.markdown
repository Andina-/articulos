2.3.A. Placing P2P in the context of the evolution of technology
================================================================

Colocando el P2P en el contexto de la evolución de la tecnología
================================================================

Premodern technology was participative, and not as differentiated and
autonomous. The instruments of artisans were extensions of their bodies,
with which they ‘cooperated’. The social lifeworld, was not yet as
differentiated into different spheres or into subject/object
distinctions, since they saw themselves, not as much as separate and
autonomous individuals, but much more as parts of a whole, following the
dictates of the whole (holism), moving in a world dominated by spirits,
the spirits of men (the ancestors), of the natural world, and of the
objects they used. (Dumont, 1981).

La tecnologia premoderna era participativa y no tan diferenciada ni autónoma.
Los instrumentos de los artesaanos eran extensiones de sus cuerpos, con los que
"cooperaban".  La vida social no estaba aun diferenciada en distintas esferas
o en distinciones sujeto/objeto ya que se veían a sí mismas no tanto como
individuos separados y autónomos sino como partes de un todo, siguiendo los
dictados del todo (holismo), moviéndose en un mundo dominado por espíritus, los
espíritus de los hombres (los ancestros), del mundo natural y de los objetos
que utilizaban.[@dumont-1981]

Modern technology could be said to be differentiated (division of
labour, differentiation of social fields, relative autonomy of
technological evolution), but is no longer participative. The
subject-object dichotomy means that nature becomes a resource to be used
(objects used by subjects). But the object, the technological
instrument, also becomes autonomous, and in the factory system typical
of modernity, a dramatic reversal takes place: it is the human who
becomes a ‘dumb’ extension of the machine. The intelligence is not so
much located in the machine, but in the organization of the production,
of which both humans and machines are mere cogs. Modern machines are not
by itself intelligent, and are organized in hierarchical frameworks.
Modern humans think themselves as autonomous agents using objects, but
become themselves objects of the systems of their own creation. This is
the drama of modernity, the key to its alienation.

Puede decirse que la tecnología moderna 

In post-modernity, machines become intelligent (though not in the same
way as humans, they can only use the intelligence put in them by the
humans, and so far lack the creative innovation, problem-solving and
decision-making capabilities). While the old paradigm of humans as
objects in a system certainly persists, a new paradigm is being born.
The intelligent machines become computers, extensions now of the human
brain and nervous system (instead of being extensions of the external
limbs and internal functions of the body in the industrial system).
Humans again start cooperating with the computers, seen as extensions of
their selves, their memories, their logical processes, but also and this
is crucial: it enables affective communication amongst a much wider
global community of humans. Of course, within the context of cognitive
capitalism (defined as the third phase of capitalism where immaterial
processes are more important than the material production; where
information ‘as property’ becomes the key asset), all this still
operates in a wider context of exploitation and domination, but the
potential is there for a new model which allies both differentiation
(the autonomous individual retains his freedom and prerogatives), and
participation. Within the information paradigm, the world of matter
(nanotech), life (biotech) and mind (AI) are reduced to their
informational basis, which can be manipulated, and this opens up
nightmarish possibilities of the extension of the resource-manipulation
paradigm, now involving our very own bodies and psyches. However,
because of the equally important paradigm of participation, the
possibility arises of a totally new, subjective-objective, cooperative
way of looking at this, and this is an element of hope.

According to the reworking of Foucault's insights by Deleuze and
Guattari, there is a clear connection between the type of society and
the type of technology that is dominant. Simple mechanistical machines
were dominant in the classical period of modernity, the period of
sovereignity (18th cy.); thermodynamic systems became dominant in the
19th cy, inaugurating disciplinary societies; finally Deleuze dates the
advent of control societies, to the advent of cybernetic machines and
computers. Our sections on the evolution of power will detail this
aspect of the evolution of technology.
