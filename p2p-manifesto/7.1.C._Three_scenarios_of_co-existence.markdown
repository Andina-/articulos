7.1.C. Three scenarios of co-existence
======================================

From P2P Foundation

**7.1.C. Three scenarios of co-existence**

In our earlier descriptive essay, we already described three possible
scenarios concerning the entanglement of cognitive capitalism with P2P.

The first scenario is peaceful co-existence. There are a lot of
historical precedents for that. In the Middle Ages and other
agriculture-based systems, the system of authority ranking (feudalism),
co-existed with the religious order, organized in a form of Communal
Shareholding (the Church and the Sangha), which was the pillar of a
redistributive gift economy. In South-East Asia, which accepts temporary
spiritual engagement, people would move from one sector to the other.
Similarly, we can envision a continuation of the present system, with
knowledge workers making money in the private sector, but regularly
escaping, as much as they possibly can, to participate in the
edification of the Commons. In this scenario, the one we are currently
living and that would be poised to continue substantially the same, the
current version of capitalism would also remain mostly unchanged, though
perhaps eventually to be regulated by bodies of global governance.

The second scenario is the dark one. Cognitive capitalism succeeds in
partly incorporating, partly destroying the P2P ethos, and an era of
information feudalism ensues, a netocratic oligarchy based on access to
resources and networks, living on rent monopolies from intellectual
property licenses, as has been described by Jeremy Rifkin in the "Age of
Access", (and echoed by Jordan Pollack , John Perry Barlow and many
others) and dis-appropriating any form of property from the consuming
classes (the consumtariat, as Alexander Bard has coined them). It will
co-exist with a total control society based on biometric identification,
and will use highly advanced cognitive manipulation. But this scenario
is predicated on the social defeat of the knowledge workers, and we are
not there yet. In this scenario, access to information is predicated on
the payment of restrictive licenses, which sharply reduce the freedoms
and the creativity of the people who have access, while excluding many
others from that access. Because of this loss of freedom, the loss also
of the freedom to fully possess goods and to with them as we please,
this scenario is often called one of 'information feudalism'.

The third scenario is, from the point of view of P2P advocates, the more
hopeful one. After a deep structural crisis, the universal wage is
implemented, and the P2P sphere can operate with increasing autonomy,
creating more and more use value, slowly creating a cohesive system
within the system, a 'GPL Society', as Stephan Merten would have it . At
such moment, the new civilization is already born. It has to be stressed
that P2P is not the same as a totally collectivized system, and that it
can co-exist with markets and aspects of capitalism. But it does not
need the current monopolistic system, it can reduce ‘market pricing
mechanisms’ to their rightful place, as part of the human exchange
system, not as its totality. In my opinion, we would have a core of pure
P2P processes, surrounded by a gift economy based on shareable goods, a
strong social economy run by non-profit companies, and a reformed market
sector, where prices reflect more realistically the true cost of
production, such as environmental externalities. This form of 'natural
capitalism' has been described by Paul Hawken, David Korten, and Hazel
Henderson. The main 'inspiring paradigm' would no longer be the
competition paradigm based on win-lose scenarios, but the collaborative
paradigm, where reformed corporations and other to-be-invented
institutional and non-institutional forms, would find their purpose in
creating added value to the commons, and would attract productive means
to the degree they are perceived of doing so.
