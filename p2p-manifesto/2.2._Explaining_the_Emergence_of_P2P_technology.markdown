2.2. Explaining the Emergence of P2P technology
===============================================

**2.2. Explaining the Emergence of P2P technology**

Why this emergence? The short answer is: P2P is a consequence of
abundance (in fact it is both cause and consequence). With the advent of
the ‘Information Age’ that started with mass media and unintegrated
private networks for multinationals, but especially with the advent of
the internet and the web itself, which allow for digital copying and
distribution of any digital creation at marginal cost, information
abundance is created. For business processes, the keyword becomes
‘flow’, and the integration of these endless flows. Production of
material goods is predicated on the management of immaterial flows. In
such a context, centralized systems almost inevitably create bottlenecks
holding up the flow. In a P2P system, any node can contact any other
node, without passing through such bottlenecks. Hierarchy only works
with scarcity, and in a situation where the control of scarce resources
determines the end result of the zero-sum power games being conducted.
In a situation of abundance, centralized nodes cannot possible cope .
From the engineering standpoint therefore, P2P is an appropriate
solution to distribute workloads among a large number of loads, a
solution which is effective in many case, but not always. Information, I
probably do not need to remind the reader of this, is different from
material goods, in that its sharing does not diminish its value, but on
the contrary augments it. Conclusion: P2P is 'deblocking'.

Second, P2P systems are predicated on redundancy, several resources are
always available to conduct any process. This makes them a lot less
vulnerable than centralized systems to any kind of disruption, P2P
systems are extraordinarily robust. One cannot, in terms of resources,
compare any centralized system, to the extraordinary combination of
millions of peripheral systems with the billions and trillions of unused
memory, computing cycles, etc…. These are only unlocked in a P2P system.

Abundance is again both a cause and a consequence of complexity. In a
situation of a multiplication of flows, flows that no longer follow
predetermined routes, it cannot possible be predicted, where the
‘solution’ for any problem lies. Expertise comes out of a precise
combination of experience, which is unpredictable in advance. Thus,
systems are needed that allow expertise to unexpectedly announce itself,
when it learns that it is needed. This is precisely what P2P systems
allow to an unprecendented degree. Conclusion: P2P is 'enabling'.

There is also a 'democratic rationale' to the above enabling of
resources. Since it is a bottom-up rather than a top-down process. P2P
is 'empowering'. It reflects the cultural evolution towards an ethos of
sharing abundant resources that gain value through their distribution.
