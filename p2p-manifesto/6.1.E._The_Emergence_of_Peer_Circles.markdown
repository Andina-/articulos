6.1.E. The Emergence of Peer Circles
====================================

From P2P Foundation

Jump to: [navigation][], [search][]

**6.1.E. The Emergence of Peer Circles**

In the cultural sphere, all these changes are expressed in the emergence
of a new organizational formal, that of peer circles. We have mentioned
the emergence of cooperative inquiry groups and peer circles in the
field of spirituality, but this is far from the only field where they
are emerging. It used to be that if you wanted to create something new
and 'collective', you would create a company, a NGO, or campaign for the
creation of a new government agency. But these institutional forms are
no longer sufficient to be fully acceptable to the P2P ethos. Attempts
at collective creation, at worldchanging are therefore increasingly
taking on the new organizational form of peer circles. Self-help groups,
not a new phenomenon, where a pre-internet prefiguration of this trend.

One example are the emergence of giving circles . These are groups of
people who pool their resources together. For example, in the particular
format of Full Circles, members donate \$1 per day, or \$360 for the
year. They collectively research local causes that are worthy of
support. Jock Gill of the Greater Democracy blog has proposed to extend
the concept to development. Giving circles would directly connect with
villages in developing countries, using internet-enabled
videoconferencing, and would fund microcredit schemes. He appropriate
call its 'citizen to citizen' development based on 'edge to edge'
relationships.
