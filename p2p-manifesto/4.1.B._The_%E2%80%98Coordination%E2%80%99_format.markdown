4.1.B. The ‘Coordination’ format
================================

From P2P Foundation

Jump to: [navigation][], [search][]

**4.1.B. The ‘Coordination’ format**

Since the mid-eighties, observers have noticed that social struggles
have taken a new format as well, that of the coordination . In France
for example, all the important struggles of the recent decade, by
nurses, by the educational workers, and most recently by the part-time
art workers (the 'intermittents'), have been led by such coordinations.
Again, such coordinations are a radical innovation. They are also based
on the principle of non-representationality: no one is elected to
represent anybody else, anyone can participate, their decisions are
based on consensus, while participants retain every freedom in their
actions. Note how the coordination thus differs from the earlier
hyper-democratic form of worker’s councils, which were still based on
the idea of representation.

The latest struggle of the artistic ‘intermittents’ was particularly
significant. These are creative knowledge workers who move from artistic
project to artistic project, and who are therefore, unlike earlier
industrial workers, not in permanent contact with each other. Yet their
‘network sociality’, which means they keep in touch with a variety of
subgroups of friends and associates to keep informed of opportunities
and for permanent collective learning and exchange, meant that, when
confronted with a reform they found intolerable, they were able to mount
one of the most effective mass social movements in a very short time,
through the use of viral diffusion techniques. Traditional power plays
by established left political parties and unions are not tolerated in
the coordinations, when they happen, people simply leave and set up shop
elsewhere. Thus authoritarian political organizations are seriously
restrained by this format.

The coordination format aims to preserve 'difference', does not strive
for 'unity' and 'centralization' of the struggle, but achieves
nevertheless 'common' goals and actions. However, in contrast with the
earlier forms of 'mass demonstrations' and 'mass strikes', the
coordination-led struggles are often organized in a 'just-in-time'
fashion of autonomous micro-actions, often geared to the interrupting of
the 'machine of the spectacle', i.e. the mass media, transport flows,
and the culture industry. It is very similar to the approach of the
alterglobalisation movement, which chooses heavily covered summits as
focal points of action.

The alterglobalisation movement and the coordination format are not
flukes, but representative of a much more general way of doing politics,
which has also been called the 'network-advocacy model' .
