4.2.A. De-Monopolization of Power
=================================

From P2P Foundation

**4.2.A. De-Monopolization of Power**

How to explain the emergence of such P2P networks in the political
field?

It reflects new cultural values, the desire that authority grows from
engagement and expertise, and that it is temporary to the task at hand.
It reflects the refusal to give away autonomy, i.e. the rejection of the
transcendence of power as defined by Toni Negri. It reflects the desire
for self-unfolding of creative potential.

Networks are incredibly efficient: they can operate globally in
real-time, react and mobilize around events in the very short term, and
offers access to alternative civic information that has not been
massaged by corporate-owned mega-media. In a political network
configuration, the participating individual retains his full autonomy.

Politically, P2P processes reflect a de-monopolization of power. Power,
in the form of reputation that generates influence, is given by the
community, is time-bound to the participation of the individual (when he
no longer participates, influence declines again), and can thus be taken
back by the participating individuals. In the case where monopolization
should occur, participants simply leave or create a ‘forking’ of the
project, a new path is formed to avoid the power grab .

There is an important counter-trend however, and it concerns the
scarcity of attention. Because our time and attention are indeed scarce
in a context of information abundance, mediating portals are created,
who collate and digest this mass of information. Think about Yahoo,
Google, Amazon, eBay who exemplify the process of monopolization in the
‘attention economy’. But the user community is not without power to
affect these processes: collective reaction through opinion storms are
activated by abusive monopolistic behavior, and can quickly damage the
reputation of the perpetrator, thereby forcing a change in behavior in
the monopolistic ambitions. Competing resources are almost always
available, or can be built by the open source community. But more
fundamentally, the blogosphere practice shows that it is possible to
route around such problems, by creating mediating processes using the
community as a whole. Thus techniques such as folksonomies, i.e.
communal tagging, or reputation ranking, such as the ‘Karma’ points used
by the Slashdot community, avoid the emergence of autonomous mediating
agents. The blogosphere itself, in the form of the Technorati ranking
system for example, has found ways to calculate the interlinking done by
countless individuals, thereby enabling itself to filter out the most
used contributions. Again, monopolization is excluded. What is the
mechanism behind this?

For this we have to turn again to the concept of
non-representationality, or what Negri calls immanence. In modernity,
the concept is that autonomous individuals cannot create a peaceful
order, and therefore they defer their power to a sovereign, whether it
be the king of the nation. In becoming a people, they become a
‘collective individual’. They loose out as individuals, while the
unified people or nation behaves ‘as if’ it was an individual, i.e. with
ambition for power. It is ‘transcendent’ vis a vis its parts. In
non-representationality however, nothing of the sort is given away. This
means that the collective hereby created, is not a ‘collective
individual’, it cannot act with ambition apart from its members. The
genius of the protocols devised in peer to peer initiatives, is that
they avoid the creation of a collective individual with agency. Instead,
it is the communion of the collective which filters value. The ethical
implication is important as well. Not having given anything up of their
full power, the participants in fact voluntarily take up the concern not
only for the whole in terms of the project, but for the social field in
which its operates.

Anticipating our ‘evolutionary’ remarks in section 4.3, we can see the
above examples as illustrating the new form of protocollary power, which
is becoming all-important in a network. The very manner in which we
devise our social technologies, implies possible and likely social
relationships. The protocols of the blogosphere enable the economy of
attention to operate, not through individual actors that can become
monopolistic, but by protocols that enable communal filtering. But when
used by private firms such as Yahoo and Google, they may have a vested
interest in skewing the protocol and the objectivity of the algorithms
used. In the blogosphere, protocols are also important since they imply
a vision: should everyone be able to judge, and in that case, would that
not lead to a lowest common denominator, or should equipotency be
defined in such a way that a certain level of expertise is required, to
allow higher quality entries to be filtered upwards?
