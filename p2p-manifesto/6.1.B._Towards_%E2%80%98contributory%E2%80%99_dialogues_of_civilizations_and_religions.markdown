6.1.B. Towards ‘contributory’ dialogues of civilizations and religions
======================================================================

**6.1.B. Towards ‘contributory’ dialogues of civilizations and
religions**

One of the more global expressions of the peer to peer ethic, is the
equipotency it creates between civilizations and religions. These have
to be seen as unique responses, temporally and spatially defined, of
specific sections of humanity, but directed towards similar challenges.
Thus we arrive at the concept of ‘contributory worldviews’ or
‘contributory theologies’. Humanity as a whole, or more precisely, its
individual members, have now access to the whole of human civilization
as a common resource. Individuals, now being considered ‘composites’
made up of various influences, belongings and identities, in constant
becoming, are embarked in a meaning-making process that is coupled to an
expansion of awareness to the well-being of the planet as a whole, and
of its concrete community of inhabitants. In order to become more
cosmopolitan they will encounter the various answers given by other
civilizations, but since they cannot fully comprehend a totally
different historical experience, this is mediated through dialogue. And
thus a process of global dialogue is created, not a synthesis or world
religion, but a mosaic of millions of personal integrations that grows
out of multiple dialogues. Rather than the concept of multiculturalism,
which implies fixed social and cultural identities, peer to peer
suggests cultural and spiritual hybridity, and which no two members of a
community have the same composite understanding and way of thinking.

One of the recent examples that came to my attention are the annual SEED
conferences in Albuquerque, New Mexico. They bring together, native
elders, quantum physicists, philosophers, and linguists, none of them
assuming superiority over one another, but collectively ‘building truth’
through their encounter.

P2P dialogues are not representative dialogues, in which the
participants represent their various religions, rather, they are
encounters of composite and hybrid experiences, in which each full
expresses his different understanding, building a spiritual commons.
