**4.1.A. The Alterglobalisation Movement**

The alterglobalisation movement is a well-known example of the P2P ethos
at work in the political field. The movement sees itself as a network of
networks that combines players from a wide variety of fields and
opinions , who, despite the fact that they do no see eye to eye on every
aspect, manage to unite around a common platform of action around
certain key events . They are able to mobilize vast numbers of people
from every continent, without having at their disposal any of the
traditional newsmedia, such as televisions, radios or newspapers.
Rather, they rely almost exclusively on the P2P technologies described
above . Thus internet media are used for communication and learning on a
continuous basis, prior to the mobilizations, but also during the
mobilizations, where independent internet media platforms such as
Indymedia, as well as the skillful use of mobile phones are used for
real-time response management , undertaken by small groups that use
buddy-list technologies, sometimes open source programs that have been
explicitly designed for political activism such as TextMob . Many
reports have appeared, including those described in Howard Rheingold’s
Smart Mobs, about the political significance of SMS in organizing
successful protests and ‘democratic revolutions’ . The network model
allows for a more fluid organization that does not fix any group in
permanent adversarial positions, but various temporary coalitions are
created on a ad hoc basis depending on the issues. A key underlying
philosophy of the movement is the paradigm of non-representationality .
Instead of representation, the movement has been experimenting with a
wide variety of new organizational formats such as the social forums
themselves . These have to navigate the tension between being a space
for dialogue and socialization, and retaining efficiency in action, i.e.
uniting around common projects. And this double objective had to be
attained while respecting three basic horizontal constraints: 1) the
continued ability to extend the network and hence maintenance of
diversity; 2) the refusal of representation; 3) decision-making by
consensus only . Contrary to previous movements in the past, who also
started operating in a peer-like manner but then either
'institutionalized' themselves to survive or dissolved, the
alterglobalisation movement seems to move in a opposite direction:
towards a further consolidation of its radical P2P premises .

The appearance of the paradigm of non-representationality is an
important social innovation that should not go unnoticed and is at the
heart of the philosophical underpinning of the P2P worldview. In classic
modern political ideology, participating members elect representatives,
and delegate their authority to them. Decisions taken by councils of
such representatives then can take binding decisions, and are allowed to
speak ‘for the movement’. But such a feature seems to be absent from the
alterglobalisation movement. In fact, article 5 of the Porto Alegre
World Social Forum charter specifically states that the movement does
not ‘represent’ global civil society . No one, not even the celebrities,
can speak for anyone else, though they can speak in their own name.
Again, some movements and people have more influence than others, but
none can be said to dominate or direct the movement as such. Another
distinguishing feature, is that we can no longer speak of ‘permanent
organizations’. While unions, political movements, and international
environmental and human rights NGO’s do participate, and have an
important role, the movement innovates by mobilizing many unaffiliated
individuals, as well as all kinds of temporary ad hoc groups created
within or without the internet. Thus we can add to the de-formalization
and de-institutionalization principles explained above, another one that
we could call the process of de-organization, as long as we are clear on
its meaning, which refers to the transcendence of ‘fixed’ organizational
formats which allows power to consolidate. What we get instead is
'shifting and dynamic structures'. However, it is important to stress
that the use of flexible structures does not mean structurelessness .
Peer governance uses different formats that share as a common
characteristic that it aims for power to be distributed to a maximum
extent.

The adherents of such movements are most often post-ideological in their
approach; they stress their difference, refuse 'permanent
identification' with any particular movement, but at the same time try
to overcome their differences through the common action. We have evolved
from a 'stamp it' militancy (from the stamps that party members used to
put in a membership booklet as proof of payment) which indicated a
lifelong ideological commitment, to a 'post-it' neo-militancy, where
these new types of organizations do not even propose membership .

A commonly heard criticism is that ‘they have no alternative’, i.e. are
not offering a precise and integrated alternative political and social
program. This in fact may reflect their new approach to politics. The
main demand is indeed not always for specifics, though that can
occasionally be part of a consensus platform (such as ‘abandoning the
debt for developing countries’), more importantly is the underlying
philosophy, that ‘another world is possible’, but that what is most
important is not asking for specific alternative, but rather for an open
process of world governance that is not governed by the power politics
and private interests of the elite, but determined by all the people in
an autonomous fashion that recognized the wide diversity of desired
futures. Thus, in that sense, the 'aim' of the alterglobalisation
movement is nothing else than a demand for a new 'organization' of the
world, based on the P2Pprinciples.

An important aspect of the alterglobalisation movement is the
above-mentioned reliance on alternative independent internet media.
Despite the overriding influence of corporate-owned mass media, groups
such as the alterglobalisation movement have succeeded in created a vast
number of alternative news outlets, in written, audio, and audiovisual
formats. Those are used for a permanent process of learning and
exchange, outside of the sphere of the ‘manufacturing of consent’ (as
described by Noam Chomsky, 2002).

Of course, the new method of organization that we described above, is
not limited to movements on the left of the political spectrum, and can
be found on the right as well. One often noted example is Al Qaeda ,
which mixes tribal, corporate but also strong network features; another
example is the leaderless resistance model advocated by some on the
extreme right .
