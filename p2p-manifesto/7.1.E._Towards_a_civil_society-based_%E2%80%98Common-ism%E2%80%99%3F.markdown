7.1.E. Towards a civil society-based ‘Common-ism’?
==================================================

**7.1.E. Towards a civil society-based ‘Common-ism’?**

Following the summary by Bruno Theret of a school of thought in
anthropology, human society can best be understood in the form of an
“original debt". Humans owe their lives to the totality and are
therefore thankful to its representatives, who eventually become real
human and spiritual powers. Up to modernity, people owed their lives to
the sovereign, representing the sacred order, and paid back this debt
materially. This is the basis of the premodern and ‘feudal’ system of
allegiance and tribute. But this symbolic process is reversed in
modernity. It is now the sovereign which is indebted to the individuals,
he gets his power from them, since democratic sovereignity derives now
from the people. From the point of the individual, he now faces a
'differentiated society'. Family life is increasingly liberated from
patriarchal domination and becomes an egalitarian alliance based on
love, with a debt from the parents towards the children (instead of the
other way around in premodernity). In the family, the person is
integral. However, in the economic order, he 'lends' his labour power to
the enterprise, who pays back this debt in form of salaries.
Politically, he delegates his 'political power' to the sovereign, as
embodied in democratic societies. For Bruno Theret, the existence of a
differentiated domestic order is of crucial importance, as it is the
domain of fraternity and reciprocity, while the market is the domain of
freedom, and the political order is the domain of power. But based on
the domestic order of the family, civil society is being created, based
on the same principles of fraternity, solidarity, reciprocity,
eventually giving rise to the great post-war compromise, in which the
market was re-embedded in the social, with salaries and a juridical
order to protect the social.

This for him, is the seed of a third type of society, not based on a
totalitarian market (the neoliberal order of the 80s and 90s), which
only protects 'freedom', and in which the market dominates everything,
nor on a totalitarian state, which only protects equality. Rather we
have a domestic order, which if it succeeds in expanding civil society
so that it becomes dominant rather than subordinate, can develop a model
of 'civil socialism'. In order to avoid becoming itself a totalitarian
communautarian order, it abandons the aim of 'simple equality' for
complex equality. Such a system accepts partial monopolies in certain
differentiated fields, but avoids that such monopolies can be converted
in other fields.

The above paragraphs are a summary of a long argumentation by Bruno
Theret. They point to the material basis of a new social and political
movement, which no longer seeks the takeover of state power, but rather
focuses on the extension of civil society and its egalitarian values. It
is no longer ‘communist’, in the Marxist sense, but rather ‘Common-ist'.
It is not lead by a bureaucratic layer of functionaries which aim to be
integrated in the state system, but is an autonomous growth within civil
society, using processes of peer governance. This is the social movement
which will find its expression in the peer to peer paradigm and is
constructing a social and political alternative.
